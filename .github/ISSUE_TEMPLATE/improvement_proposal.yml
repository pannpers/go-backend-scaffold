        **Area of Improvement:**
        The CI `test` job currently takes over 5 minutes to run on every pull request.

        **Motivation / Benefit:**
        Reducing the CI execution time will speed up the development cycle, allow for faster feedback on pull requests, and reduce costs on GitHub Actions runners.

        - **For CI:** Cache the `govulncheck` binary to avoid reinstalling it on every run.
        - **For Refactoring:** Refactor the `PostRepository` to use a more generic interface to improve testability.
        - **For Documentation:** Restructure the README to include a "Getting Started" section for new contributors.
